Being a classification project, we first explored a very simple model, the logistic regression. As anticipated, it was the quickest to run, but giving an average score. One interesting thing we noticed was that tweaking the parameters had not changed the validation accuracy/score by a lot, or the Kaggle score. We discuss more about this later. We explored other models including decision tree, random forest, xgboost, MLP and SVM. The table below shows the score and average time for each model.
